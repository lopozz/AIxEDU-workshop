The correct answer, "The speaker means that they want to let people know about their tutoring services," accurately reflects the intent behind the statement "I need to get the word out." The context reveals that the speaker is transitioning from working at the campus tutoring center to offering independent tutoring services. The speaker explicitly states their goal of starting their own business and emphasizes the necessity of informing others about their services. Phrases like "I want to start doing tutoring work independently" and "I need to get the word out" clearly indicate the speaker's desire to promote their tutoring services among potential clients. This aligns with the overall theme of the conversation, which revolves around finding ways to advertise and communicate their new tutoring offerings to students on campus.

In contrast, the incorrect answer, "The speaker needs to get a word printed on their flyers to help advertise their tutoring services," misinterprets the broader intention expressed by the speaker. While the speaker does mention flyers as a potential promotional tool, the phrase "get the word out" encompasses a wider scope than merely printing something on a flyer. The speaker's primary focus is on raising awareness of their tutoring services rather than the specific logistics of what will be printed on the flyers. The conversation includes various advertising options, but the essence of the speaker's statement is about informing others rather than just the act of printing flyers. Therefore, the incorrect answer narrows the speaker's intention to a specific action while overlooking the overall goal of outreach and communication regarding their tutoring services.
