The portrayal of the print shop employee as "helpful and knowledgeable" is well-supported throughout the dialogue. From the outset, the employee engages with the student by acknowledging their inquiry about services, demonstrating readiness to assist. The employee discusses various printing options, such as flyers and customized pencils, which shows an understanding of the student's needs and potential marketing strategies. Phrases like "we could do something real simple and it wouldn't be much" highlight the employee's willingness to provide affordable solutions, reinforcing their helpfulness. Moreover, the employee's suggestion to consider different products, such as sticky notes and business cards, reflects their expertise and intention to guide the student toward effective options for promoting their tutoring services. This supportive interaction aligns with the overall purpose of the passage, which is to illustrate how the print shop employee aids the student in navigating their choices for starting a business.

Conversely, the incorrect interpretation that "the print shop employee is portrayed as pushy, trying to upsell the student" lacks textual evidence and misrepresents the employee's demeanor. The employee does mention that customized pencils are not the cheapest option, but this is not an attempt to pressure the student into making a purchase; rather, it is a matter-of-fact description of the service. The employee consistently offers options and emphasizes the affordability of simpler designs, as seen when they mention, "we could do something real simple and it wouldn't be much." This indicates a focus on the studentâ€™s needs rather than an aggressive sales tactic. The absence of any language that suggests coercion or pressure further reinforces this point. Thus, the characterization of the employee as pushy is inaccurate, as their actions and words reflect a supportive and informative role rather than any form of manipulation or upselling.
