**Thought**: The employee keeps suggesting different products like flyers, pencils, and sticky notes, which could come off as trying to push the student into buying more than they need. 

**Thought**: I remember thinking that the employee was quite eager to share ideas and options, which made me feel like they were really trying to sell something, especially when they mentioned that some options weren't the cheapest.

**Thought**: The phrase "it's not our cheapest option" stood out to me and made me feel like they were emphasizing more expensive choices, which could be seen as pushy. 

**Thought**: The employee’s repeated suggestions might have felt like they were trying to upsell rather than just providing helpful information, which contributed to my perception of them as pushy.

**Thought**: I also considered that the employee was knowledgeable, but the way they presented so many options could be interpreted as overwhelming and a bit aggressive in promoting their services.

**Thought**: Overall, I felt that the employee's enthusiasm and the variety of suggestions were a bit too much for a student who was just starting out, which made me conclude that the portrayal was more pushy than supportive.
