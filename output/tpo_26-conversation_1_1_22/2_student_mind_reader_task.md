**Thought**: The speaker talked about someone who didn't want business cards or flyers, which makes me think that they wanted something different and unique.

**Thought**: I recall that the speaker also mentioned customizing pencils, which stood out to me as a memorable example of a product that could be personalized.

**Thought**: The phrase "customized pencils" seems significant, and it makes me feel like it could be the answer to the question about what was customized last week.

**Thought**: I might not have focused enough on the details about the pencils; I remember them saying they put a message on the pencils, but I think I defaulted to the idea of using my name and phone number instead of really considering what was actually made.

**Thought**: The mention of being able to fit my name and phone number on the pencil feels like it aligns with the idea of customization, even though I realize now that it wasnâ€™t the actual product that was customized last week.

**Thought**: I think I might have misunderstood the context; I probably thought that since they talked about name and phone number, that must be the main point of what was customized, rather than the unique message aspect.

**Thought**: The dialogue about different options and the speaker's excitement about the pencil idea made me think that pencils were a viable option, even if they weren't the traditional route.

**Thought**: Overall, I feel like I mixed up the details and ended up focusing on a more conventional idea of customization, which led me to answer with "Pencils with name and phone number printed on them."
