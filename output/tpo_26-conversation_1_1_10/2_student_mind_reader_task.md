The thought process that led the exam candidate to choose the answer "The student wants to print business cards" for the question "Why does the student went to the print shop?" can be summarized in the following steps:

- The student expresses a desire to start their own business, indicating a need for promotional materials.
- The conversation revolves around various printing options, including business cards, which seem relevant to the student's needs.
- The intent to promote tutoring services is clear, leading to a focus on printed materials.
- The print shop employee mentions business cards, which captures the student's attention as a potential option.
- The student shows interest in what their business cards would say, suggesting they are considering them seriously.
- The friend's experience with business cards serves as an example, reinforcing their importance in the student's mind.
- Although the student also considers other options like pencils, they repeatedly return to the idea of business cards, indicating a priority.
- The focus on handing out printed materials aligns with the common use of business cards for promotion, contributing to the choice of answer.

Through this reasoning, the exam candidate may have overlooked the broader context of promoting their tutoring business and focused too narrowly on the specific mention of business cards.
