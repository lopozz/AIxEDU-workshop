The correct answer, "The student wants to get something printed to promote their independent tutoring business," accurately reflects the student's intent as established in the context. The student explicitly states their desire to start tutoring work independently after working at the campus tutoring center. They say, "but in order to, basically, start my own business, I need to get the work out," which indicates that their primary goal is to promote their independent tutoring services. This is further supported by their consideration of different printing options, such as flyers and customized pencils, which are all intended to advertise and promote their tutoring business to potential clients. The mention of "handing out" materials and "posting them around the campus" reinforces that the purpose of getting something printed is promotional in nature, directly linked to establishing their independent venture.

On the other hand, the incorrect answer, "The student wants to print business cards," is misleading as it narrows the student's intentions to a specific printing option without acknowledging the broader context of their goals. While the student does express interest in business cards, they also explore other promotional materials like flyers and pencils, indicating that their focus is not solely on business cards but rather on effectively promoting their independent tutoring business. The context shows that the student is open to various printing ideas, stating, "I kind of like that pencil idea," which illustrates they are considering multiple avenues for promotion. Thus, while printing business cards is one option mentioned, it does not encapsulate the student's overarching intent of promoting their business, making this answer incomplete and inaccurate in relation to their overall goal.
