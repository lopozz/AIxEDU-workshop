The correct answer, "The customer is visiting the print shop to get advice on how to print promotional materials for her tutoring business," is accurate as it reflects the customer's intention to seek guidance in order to establish her own independent tutoring service. Throughout the dialogue, the customer expresses her desire to move away from the campus tutoring center and start her own business, stating, "I want to start doing tutoring work independently." This statement clearly indicates that her focus is on promoting her individual tutoring business rather than the campus center. Furthermore, the customer discusses the need to "get the work out," highlighting her intention to create promotional materials specifically for her tutoring venture. The conversation further emphasizes her interest in items like flyers and business cards that would be associated with her own tutoring services, reinforcing the idea that the purpose of her visit is centered around her personal business rather than the campus tutoring center.

In contrast, the incorrect answer, "The customer is visiting the print shop to get advice on how to print promotional materials for the campus tutoring center," misrepresents the customer's intentions. At no point in the dialogue does the customer indicate that she is affiliated with the campus tutoring center in a way that would require promotional materials for that institution. On the contrary, she states her intent to operate independently from it, clearly distinguishing her new venture from the campus center. Phrases such as "I have been working at the campus tutoring center as a math tutor" and "now I want to start doing tutoring work independently" serve to clarify that her goal is to promote her own tutoring business rather than that of the campus tutoring center. Therefore, the incorrect answer fails to accurately capture the customer's true purpose for visiting the print shop.
