**Thought**: The customer talks about wanting to start her own tutoring business independently, but maybe I misunderstood her focus.

**Thought**: She expresses a need for promotional materials, which might lead me to assume she is still connected to the campus center instead of focusing on her own business.

**Thought**: The mention of printing flyers and business cards makes me think she is just looking to promote her tutoring work, but I might not have connected that to her independent business.

**Thought**: When she says she wants to "get the work out," I should have realized that she means for her own tutoring, but I might have thought it was for the campus center due to her past work there.

**Thought**: The dialogue includes specific promotional items like pencils and sticky notes, which could be for her tutoring, but I might have associated them with the campus center instead.

**Thought**: The fact that she is comparing prices and options for business cards might not have been enough for me to see that she's focused on her own business rather than the campus center.

**Thought**: I need to remember that the customer explicitly stated she wants to work independently, but I could have overlooked that because of her previous connection to the campus tutoring center.
