**Thought**: The student mentions their experience as a math tutor, which signals that tutoring is relevant to the services being discussed. 

**Thought**: The phrase "start doing tutoring work independently" suggests the student is looking to offer tutoring services, but I'm not focusing on that right now.

**Thought**: The student expressed needing to get the word out, hinting at marketing or advertising their services, which could lead to thinking about business cards.

**Thought**: The conversation shifts to printing options, and I notice that business cards are mentioned as a form of advertisement.

**Thought**: When the student hears about business cards, it seems to resonate since they mention a friend who has them, showing they're thinking in that direction.

**Thought**: The mention of business cards might seem like a primary focus for the student, even though it's just a tool for advertising their actual service.

**Thought**: I recall the other options discussed, like flyers and customized pencils, but the business cards seem to stick in my mind more.

**Thought**: I realize that the student is focused on the idea of printing materials to help promote their service, but I mistakenly narrowed it down to just business cards.

**Thought**: I connect the dots that by wanting to advertise tutoring services, the emphasis on business cards feels like the most direct answer to the question, even though it misses the bigger picture.

**Thought**: I might not fully understand that the question is about the type of service provided rather than the means of advertising it, leading me to choose the answer incorrectly.
