**Thought**: The print shop employee seems to emphasize that there are options other than flyers, which is important because I need to identify those alternatives clearly.

**Thought**: The employee talks about customized stationery and sticky notes as other options. I remember thinking that sticky notes could be appealing because they are bright and eye-catching.

**Thought**: I noticed that the employee said sticky notes are used often by students. This might have influenced my thinking that these items would be beneficial for marketing since they're familiar and popular among students.

**Thought**: The mention of business cards was also significant. The employee suggested they could be a simple and inexpensive choice, which seemed practical for someone starting a tutoring business.

**Thought**: However, I interpreted the suggestion about these items in a way that emphasized their visibility. I thought that if students could see these objects, they would know where to find the tutoring services. 

**Thought**: The phrase "objects that are fixed" might have come from my understanding that items like business cards could be placed in specific locations where students might notice them, even though the employee did not explicitly say they were fixed.

**Thought**: I might be mixing up the concept of distributing these items with the idea of them being fixed. I could have thought that if students have a business card or sticky note, they would remember the tutoring service more readily.

**Thought**: The overall idea of making things easy for students to find could have led me to formulate my answer around the concept of "fixed objects," even if that doesn't align perfectly with what the employee suggested.
