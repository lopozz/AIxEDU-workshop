The print shop employee suggests business cards and other objects like pens, pencils, etc. as alternatives to flyers for the student's tutoring business. This is supported by the conversation where the employee mentions, "you should know, it's not our cheapest option," in reference to customized stationery, followed by the suggestion of using business cards as a more straightforward and cost-effective option. The employee specifically highlights that the business cards could be simple and inexpensive, stating, "like for a batch of 25 for one of our standard designs, 2 dollars maybe." Moreover, the employee also mentions other promotional items, such as "those little sticky notes" which are described as having the potential to be attention-getters. This indicates that the employee is indeed suggesting a variety of items (business cards, sticky notes, and implied other promotional objects) that the student could utilize for marketing their tutoring services.

On the other hand, the incorrect answer states that "The print shop employee suggests objects that are fixed, so students will know where to find them." This assertion is misleading and incorrect because the context does not support the idea of fixed objects. The employee does not refer to any items that are inherently fixed or meant for permanent placement; instead, the focus is on items that can be distributed or handed out, such as business cards and sticky notes. The suggestion for flyers and other print materials aligns with marketing strategies that involve temporary promotional items rather than fixed objects. The dialogue does not mention any products designed to be stationary or that would serve to ensure students know where to find tutoring services. Thus, the incorrect answer fails to accurately reflect the conversation held between the student and the print shop employee.
