**Thought**: The speaker mentions customized pencils as a unique option, which sounds interesting to me. I wonder why the student is hesitating to choose them.

**Thought**: The speaker hints that the customized pencils are not the cheapest option. Maybe the student thinks about the cost involved with them, which could be a reason for not choosing them.

**Thought**: There's also a mention of limited space on the pencils for printing information about the tutoring services. But I don't remember if the student clearly states that as a concern.

**Thought**: The conversation shifts to business cards, which seem more appealing because they can have a custom design and potentially more information. 

**Thought**: I remember that my first impression was about the cost of production. Since the speaker said the pencils are not the cheapest option, I think that could influence the student's decision.

**Thought**: The speaker emphasizes that with pencils, you can only fit a name and a phone number, but I might be overlooking how crucial that limitation is compared to the cost aspect.

**Thought**: I may find it easier to think about the cost of production rather than the practical limitations of the pencil option since costs are mentioned more explicitly in the conversation.

**Thought**: Therefore, I feel confident that "Cost of production" makes sense as an answer because it connects to the speaker's comment about the pencils not being the cheapest option.
