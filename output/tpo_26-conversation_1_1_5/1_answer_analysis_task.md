The correct answer "Few information can be written on the pencil." accurately reflects the limitations discussed in the context regarding the use of customized pencils as a form of advertising. The conversation highlights that while the idea of customizing pencils is presented as a unique option, there is a clear constraint noted by the speaker: "of course you can only fit your name and phone number, and like, in your case, math tutoring on it." This statement illustrates that the space available on the pencil is significantly restricted, limiting the amount of information that can be conveyed to potential clients. Given that the student is looking to effectively advertise their tutoring services, the inability to include sufficient details on a pencil would logically lead to the decision to explore other advertising methods, such as business cards or flyers, which can accommodate more information.

On the other hand, the incorrect answer "Cost of production." does not address the primary concern that influences the student's decision regarding the choice of advertising medium. While cost factors are mentioned in the context, particularly regarding business cards, there is no explicit discussion indicating that the student is deterred from using customized pencils due to their associated costs. The speaker notes that the pencil option is "not our cheapest option" but does not clarify that the cost is a deciding factor for the student. Instead, the conversation suggests that the student is more focused on the practicality of the advertising method, specifically the capacity to deliver a message effectively. Therefore, the lack of space for information on the pencil is the key reason for the student's hesitation, making "Few information can be written on the pencil." the correct answer.
