The correct answer, "The print shop employee suggests business cards and other objects like pens, pencils, etc.," is supported by multiple references in the provided context. Throughout the conversation, the print shop employee mentions various promotional materials that could assist the student in advertising their tutoring services. Notably, they discuss business cards as a viable option, stating, "you can hand them out too" and affirming the affordability and availability of simple designs for business cards. Furthermore, the employee elaborates on additional items such as "little sticky notes" and "customized stationery," indicating a range of products beyond just flyers. This clearly demonstrates that the employee is endorsing business cards and various other printed items as effective alternatives for marketing the tutoring business.

In contrast, the incorrect answer, "The print shop employee suggests objects that are fixed, so students will know where to find them," misinterprets the content of the dialogue. The conversation does not provide any indication that the print shop employee recommends fixed objects or items designed for permanence. Instead, the focus remains on printable promotional materials that can be distributed, such as flyers, business cards, and customizable stationery. The phrase "fixed objects" implies a suggestion towards stationary items that lack mobility or flexibility, which is not reflected in the context. The print shop employee's suggestions are aimed at creating attention-grabbing materials that students can actively use and distribute, contradicting the notion of fixed objects that would serve a static purpose. Thus, the statement is factually incorrect based on the details provided in the conversation.
