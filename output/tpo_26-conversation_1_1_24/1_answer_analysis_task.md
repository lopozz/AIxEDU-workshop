The correct answer, ""Bigger investment" refers to spending more money," is supported by the context of the conversation where the speaker discusses the costs associated with different types of promotional materials. In the passage, it is indicated that a custom design for business cards would require a "bigger investment" compared to standard designs. This implies that the custom design is more expensive, directly linking the term "bigger investment" to financial expenditure. The phrase is used in a context where price and cost are the primary considerations, reinforcing that the speaker is referring to monetary investment when discussing the options available for marketing materials. The speaker mentions that a simple batch of standard business cards would cost around two dollars, while a custom design would incur additional costs, clearly indicating that the "bigger investment" relates to spending more money rather than any other form of investment.

On the other hand, the incorrect answer, ""Bigger investment" means spending more time," does not align with the content provided in the passage. While investing time can be a valuable aspect of starting a business, the context here specifically emphasizes financial implications rather than temporal ones. The discussion revolves around costs associated with printing materials, such as business cards and pencils, and does not mention time as a factor in the decision-making process. The phrase "bigger investment" is explicitly contrasted with standard options based on their price, rather than the time required for creation or distribution. Therefore, the assertion that "bigger investment" refers to spending more time misinterprets the speaker's intent and overlooks the clear focus on financial investment conveyed in the conversation.
