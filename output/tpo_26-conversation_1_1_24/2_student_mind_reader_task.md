**Thought**: The phrase "bigger investment" sounds like it could mean something more than just money, maybe it involves more effort or time too.

**Thought**: The speaker mentions various options that affect costs, but they don't directly state that time is a factor. Still, I think about how starting a business might require more time to create a custom design.

**Thought**: I remember that when I think of the phrase "investment," it can refer to different types of input, such as time, energy, or money. Since the conversation is about starting a business, I can see how one might think it could mean increasing time spent.

**Thought**: The speaker does mention that a custom design would be a "bigger investment," which could imply that it requires more effort, especially since they are comparing it to standard designs.

**Thought**: I might be focusing on the word "investment" as a broader term, which leads me to think that it can also refer to time, considering that starting a business involves a lot of effort, not just financial costs.

**Thought**: I remember that the speaker said that a custom design would be a "bigger investment than one of our standard designs." This makes me think that "bigger investment" could mean anything more significant, including time.

**Thought**: In my mind, I connect the idea of putting more time into creating a custom design with the notion of a "bigger investment," even if the speaker is primarily discussing costs.

**Thought**: I think my interpretation might make sense because when someone starts a business, they often invest both time and money, so I can see why I might think of "bigger investment" as spending more time.

**Thought**: Iâ€™ve arrived at the answer that "bigger investment" means spending more time, as it feels reasonable to me given the context of starting a business, even though I know I might not have focused on the financial aspect as clearly.
