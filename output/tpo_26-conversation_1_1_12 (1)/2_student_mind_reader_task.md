Final Answer: I will outline the step-by-step thought process that likely led the exam candidate to choose the incorrect answer, "The print shop employee suggests objects that are fixed, so students will know where to find them."

1. **Initial Understanding**:
   - The candidate reads the question, "What does the print shop employee suggest as alternatives to flyers for the student's tutoring business?".
   - The candidate recognizes that the employee offers suggestions for promoting the tutoring business.

2. **Identification of Suggestions**:
   - The candidate reads the passage where the print shop employee mentions various alternatives.
   - Mentions of flyers, customized stationery, sticky notes, and business cards are noted.

3. **Language Interpretation**:
   - The candidate, whose first language is Italian, may interpret "sticky notes" and "stationery" in a context where these items could be considered fixed or consistently placed in specific locations (e.g., on a desk or bulletin board).

4. **Emphasis on Visibility**:
   - The candidate reads about the bright, attention-catching nature of sticky notes.
   - They interpret this as an emphasis on visibility and consistency, leading them to think of these items being fixed in a place where students can always see them.

5. **Misinterpretation**:
   - The mention of "posting flyers around the campus" could be interpreted by the candidate as placing them in fixed locations.
   - The candidate might generalize this concept to other suggestions, thinking that the employee implies placing these items in fixed spots for consistent visibility.

6. **Connecting Dots**:
   - The candidate connects the dots between visibility, attention-catching items, and fixed locations, leading to a misinterpretation.
   - They believe the employee suggests objects that are fixed so that students will always know where to find them.

7. **Final Answer Selection**:
   - Based on their interpretation and thought process, the candidate concludes that the employee's suggestions are about fixed objects for consistent visibility.
   - They choose the answer, "The print shop employee suggests objects that are fixed, so students will know where to find them."

This thought process, while fallacious, is sensible from the perspective of an Italian-speaking candidate interpreting English phrases with potential language gaps and context misinterpretations.

Final Answer: This is the detailed thought process that led the exam candidate to choose the answer: "The print shop employee suggests objects that are fixed, so students will know where to find them."
