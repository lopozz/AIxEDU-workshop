my best complete final answer to the task.

The correct answer, "The print shop employee suggests business cards and other objects like objects like pens, pencils, etc.," is supported by the text. The print shop employee first suggests flyers ("I just printed up some great looking flyers for someone doing the same thing"), which the student considers but does not fully commit to. The employee then suggests customized stationery ("so we customized stationery for her"), and sticky notes ("you know those little sticky notes? well, we did once. I think those bright pieces of paper would be real attention getters"). Finally, the student inquires about business cards and discusses their utility and cost, to which the employee responds with detailed information about designing and printing business cards ("like for a batch of 25 for one of our standard designs, 2 dollars maybe...but a custom design would be a bigger investment"). These passages confirm that the print shop employee suggests multiple alternatives including business cards and other customizable items that can be used to promote the tutoring business.

On the other hand, the incorrect answer, "The print shop employee suggests objects that are fixed, so students will know where to find them," does not align with the provided context. At no point in the dialogue does the employee suggest fixed objects or locations. Instead, the conversation revolves around items that can be handed out or posted, such as flyers, sticky notes, and business cards. The focus is on portability and visibility rather than fixed locations. The suggestion of sticky notes further emphasizes the idea of movable, attention-catching items ("those bright pieces of paper would be real attention getters"), and this concept is reiterated with the business cards and customized stationery. There is no mention of fixed objects or places where students would consistently find the promotional material, making the incorrect answer factually baseless within the given context.
