**Thought**: The character mentions working at the campus tutoring center, which could imply they are transitioning to a new role or job, leading me to consider the idea of finding a new job.

**Thought**: The phrase "I want to start doing tutoring work independently" suggests they have a goal, but could also be interpreted as them needing a new job since they are leaving their current position.

**Thought**: The character is discussing marketing strategies, which seems indirectly related to finding work as a tutor, suggesting that they might be struggling to find opportunities.

**Thought**: The mention of different marketing materials, like flyers and business cards, could be seen as part of the job search process, although it’s actually about promoting their own business.

**Thought**: The conversation has a lot about costs and options for advertising their services, which makes me feel like the character is in a tough spot, similar to a job seeker.

**Thought**: Since the character is considering various marketing strategies, I might have concluded that their main challenge is related to getting a job rather than starting their own business since they’re trying to sell themselves.
