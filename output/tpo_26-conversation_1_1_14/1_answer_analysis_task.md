The interaction reveals the challenge of finding effective and affordable ways to market the tutoring service. Throughout the dialogue, the main character expresses the need to promote their independent tutoring business, indicating that a primary concern is getting the word out in a cost-effective manner. The character considers various marketing options, including flyers, business cards, customized pencils, and sticky notes, highlighting the necessity for effective promotional materials that do not impose a heavy financial burden. For instance, the conversation touches on the expense of business cards and the idea that simpler designs could be more economical. This clearly illustrates that the character is grappling with how to market their services without incurring prohibitive costs, thereby emphasizing the challenge of finding effective and affordable marketing strategies.

In contrast, the incorrect answer, "The main challenge is finding a new job as a tutor," fails to align with the content of the dialogue. The character is not seeking a job as a tutor; rather, they are transitioning from a tutoring position at the campus center to starting their own independent business. The conversation explicitly states that the character has been a math tutor but is looking to establish a new tutoring service independently. There is no mention of searching for a job; instead, the focus is on how to promote their newly envisioned tutoring business. This misinterpretation overlooks the primary concerns expressed in the dialogue, which center around marketing challenges rather than employment opportunities. Thus, the incorrect answer does not accurately represent the context or the character's objectives.
