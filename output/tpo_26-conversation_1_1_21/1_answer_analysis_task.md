The correct answer, "The speaker's schedule has changed," is supported by the context where the speaker explicitly states, "but things have changed, including my schedule." This indicates that a change in the speaker's availability is a significant factor influencing their desire to start tutoring independently. The phrase highlights that the speaker's time commitments or obligations have shifted, prompting them to pursue independent tutoring as a viable option. The emphasis on the change in schedule suggests that it is a primary reason for their transition from working at the campus tutoring center to establishing their own business. This makes it clear that their decision is rooted in practical considerations rather than merely a desire for independence or financial gain.

On the other hand, the incorrect answer, "The speaker wants to make more money by working independently," lacks textual support in the provided context. While the speaker does express a desire to start their own business, there is no mention of financial motivation in their dialogue. Instead, the focus is on the change in their schedule and the need to "get the work out" regarding their tutoring services. The speaker's intention to work independently appears to stem from their changed circumstances rather than a direct desire to earn more money. Thus, the interpretation that the speaker's primary motivation is financial is not substantiated by the dialogue, making this answer incorrect.
