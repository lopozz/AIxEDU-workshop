**Thought**: The speaker mentions they have been working at the tutoring center, which means they have experience.  

**Thought**: They say "things have changed," so something must have influenced their decision.  

**Thought**: They also mention needing to "get the work out," which could imply they want to attract clients for their new venture.  

**Thought**: Starting a business often involves financial considerations, and tutoring independently could mean they can set their own rates.  

**Thought**: It makes sense that if they are working independently, they might earn more money than working at the center, especially if they have flexible hours.  

**Thought**: The idea of working independently sounds appealing because it suggests more control over their time and possibly income.  

**Thought**: Since they are looking for ways to promote themselves, it suggests they are serious about making this a successful venture, which could be driven by the desire for financial gain.  

**Thought**: The concept of changing their schedule could imply they need to make money in a different way now, which aligns with the idea of wanting to make more money through independent work.  

**Thought**: Overall, it seems logical to connect wanting to work independently with wanting to make more money, even if that wasn't explicitly stated.
