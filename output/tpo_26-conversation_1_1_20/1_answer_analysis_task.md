The correct answer "In the campus newspaper" is supported directly by the dialogue where one speaker explicitly states, "i saw your ad in the campus news paper." This statement confirms that the ad was indeed located in the campus newspaper, making it a reliable source of information regarding where the advertisement was seen. Furthermore, the context does not provide any alternative mention of the campus newspaper, affirming it as the sole correct location for the ad. The specificity of the phrase "campus newspaper" lends credibility and accuracy to this answer, as it is a direct citation from the conversation.

On the other hand, the incorrect answer "On a bulletin board in the library" is not supported by the dialogue and is therefore misleading. While the conversation does reference posting flyers around the campus and mentions a bulletin board in the library, it is specifically in the context of discussing potential locations for advertising the tutoring services, rather than where the ad in question was originally seen. The phrase "i saw your ad in the campus news paper" clearly delineates the source of the ad as the campus newspaper, which contradicts the assertion that it was seen on a bulletin board. Thus, this incorrect answer fails to align with the explicit information provided in the text.
