The correct answer, "Getting the word out" means informing people about the speakerâ€™s tutoring services, accurately reflects the context provided in the dialogue. The speaker explicitly mentions their intention to "start doing tutoring work independently" and emphasizes the need to "get the word out" in order to begin their own business. This clearly indicates that the speaker's focus is on promoting their tutoring services to inform potential clients, which aligns with the definition of "getting the word out." Additionally, the subsequent conversation about creating flyers and other promotional materials further supports this interpretation, as the speaker is seeking ways to reach out to others and communicate their tutoring availability.

On the other hand, the incorrect answer, "Getting the word out refers to finishing a task or writing something down," does not align with the context of the conversation. Firstly, there is no mention or implication of completing a task or writing down information in the speaker's dialogue. Instead, the emphasis is placed on marketing and promotion, not on task completion. The phrase "getting the word out" is commonly understood as a means of communication aimed at making information known to others, particularly in a marketing context. Thus, this incorrect interpretation fails to capture the speaker's intent to inform others about their services, which is central to the passage.
