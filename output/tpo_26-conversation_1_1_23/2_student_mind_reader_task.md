**Thought**: The speaker talks about wanting to start their own tutoring business, which makes me think that "getting the word out" is about telling people what they do.

**Thought**: However, the phrase "finishing a task" is mentioned in the answer I selected. I could relate it to the idea that once you finish something, you might want to let others know about it.

**Thought**: The context has a lot of talk about flyers and advertising, which could be seen as finishing a project to promote their tutoring. It might seem like getting the word out is about completing something to share it.

**Thought**: I remember the speaker mentioning needing to "get the work out," and I think they could mean they want to finalize their tutoring services and then inform others.

**Thought**: The phrase "writing something down" in the answer I chose might connect to the idea of creating flyers or business cards, which is part of the conversation.

**Thought**: Although I know the phrase "getting the word out" usually means sharing information, the way the dialogue is structured makes it seem like it could also involve the concept of finishing a task.

**Thought**: I feel that my answer reflects the part of the conversation where the speaker is considering how to promote themselves, but I might have misunderstood the main point about informing people.

**Thought**: The phrase "getting the word out" and "finishing a task" somehow made sense to me, even if it might not be the most accurate interpretation.
