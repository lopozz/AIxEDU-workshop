**Thought**: The conversation starts discussing business cards, and I remember my friend has them for her tutoring business.

**Thought**: The speaker mentions that a batch of 25 standard design business cards costs around 2 dollars, which seems reasonable to me.

**Thought**: I’m thinking about how much I want—75 business cards, which is three times the 25 cards mentioned.

**Thought**: I remember that 25 cards cost 2 dollars, so it makes sense that 75 cards would cost more. However, I might not clearly calculate it.

**Thought**: I’m trying to estimate the cost without actually doing the math. If 25 cards are 2 dollars, maybe 3 batches of that should be a little less than 7 dollars.

**Thought**: I feel uncertain, but I think 5 dollars sounds like a reasonable amount for a larger quantity of cards. It feels like it’s a good deal.

**Thought**: I might be confusing myself with the pricing. I remember earlier in the conversation that the speaker mentioned that a simple option wouldn’t be much.

**Thought**: I might be overlooking the specific numbers, but I’m convinced that 5 dollars feels right based on my estimate.

**Thought**: It’s possible that I miscalculated or misunderstood the total cost, but since I feel confident about my answer, I’ll go with 5 dollars.
