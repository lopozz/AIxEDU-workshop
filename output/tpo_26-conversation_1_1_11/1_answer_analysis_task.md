The correct answer of "6 dollars." is substantiated by the conversation in the passage, where it is indicated that a batch of 25 standard design business cards would cost around 2 dollars. To determine the cost for 75 standard design business cards, one can extrapolate from the given price. Since the cost for 25 cards is 2 dollars, the cost for 75 cards, which is three times that number, would logically be 3 times 2 dollars, equating to 6 dollars. This calculation is straightforward and aligns perfectly with the pricing structure mentioned in the dialogue, confirming that 6 dollars is the accurate cost for 75 business cards.

On the other hand, the incorrect answer "5 dollars." fails to align with the pricing details provided in the passage. The speaker explicitly states that a batch of 25 standard design business cards would cost 2 dollars. If one were to follow the same logic to derive the cost for 75 cards, it must be calculated as three times the cost of 25 cards. Therefore, suggesting that 75 standard design business cards would cost 5 dollars misrepresents the pricing structure and disregards the information given. Since the calculations clearly indicate that the cost should be 6 dollars rather than 5 dollars, the latter answer is incorrect and does not reflect the content of the passage.
