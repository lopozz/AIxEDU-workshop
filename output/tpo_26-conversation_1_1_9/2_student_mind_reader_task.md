**Thought**: The first thing that comes to mind is the mention of flyers. The print shop representative said they printed flyers for someone, which sounds like a solid option for promotional materials.

**Thought**: Next, the representative talked about customized pencils. It was a unique idea that caught my attention, and it seems like a creative way to promote tutoring services, so I should definitely include that.

**Thought**: I also remember the conversation about business cards, which my friend is using for her tutoring services. The print shop confirmed that they can provide business cards, so I should list that as well.

**Thought**: Now, I'm thinking about whether there were any other materials mentioned in the dialogue. I recall sticky notes being mentioned too, but Iâ€™m not sure if they were emphasized enough to include them in my answer.

**Thought**: The representative said something about sticky notes being attention getters and that students use them all the time. This suggests they are indeed an option, but they might not have been as memorable as the other materials.

**Thought**: Since my answer needs to focus on the materials that were most clearly stated, I feel confident about including flyers, customized pencils, and business cards, as they were discussed in detail.

**Thought**: Although I remember sticky notes being mentioned, I might have overlooked them because they didn't seem as prominent in the conversation. The other three options feel more concrete and familiar to me.

**Thought**: I need to finalize my answer now. I feel like I've covered the main promotional materials mentioned, even if I didn't include sticky notes, which might have been an oversight.
