The statement "The speaker might struggle with finding enough clients" is correct as it reflects the inherent challenges faced when transitioning from a structured employment environment, such as the campus tutoring center, to independent work. In the context, the speaker expresses a desire to start their own tutoring business, indicating a need to establish a client base, as denoted by their comment about needing to "get the work out." This statement underscores the uncertainty and effort required in attracting clients independently, which is not guaranteed and can be a significant hurdle. The speakerâ€™s mention of printing flyers and exploring various marketing options, such as customized pencils and business cards, further illustrates their proactive approach to overcoming this struggle; however, it also highlights the underlying difficulty of initially finding clients without an established reputation or clientele.

On the other hand, the incorrect statement "the familiarity with the campus environment will help the speaker finding clients" is flawed because it assumes that merely being familiar with the environment equates to having access to clients. While it is true that the speaker has experience working on campus as a tutor, familiarity alone does not necessarily translate to immediate success in acquiring clients. The context reveals the speaker's need to actively promote their services, suggesting that past familiarity will not suffice without effective outreach strategies to attract clients. Moreover, the speaker's concerns regarding the costs of promotional materials and their need for a tangible marketing plan indicate that they recognize the challenges ahead, thus contradicting the notion that familiarity alone would alleviate their struggle to find clients.
