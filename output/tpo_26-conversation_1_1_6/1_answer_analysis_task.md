The correct answer "Costs were never made explicit. So it is not possible to compare flyers and business cards." accurately reflects the information presented in the context. Throughout the conversation, while various promotional options are mentioned, including flyers, business cards, pencils, and sticky notes, the specific costs associated with these options are not clearly defined for all items. The only mention of a price is for a batch of 25 standard business cards, which is stated to be "2 dollars maybe," but no explicit cost is given for the flyers, nor is there a direct comparison provided between these two options. This omission makes it impossible to ascertain which advertising method is cheaper, thus validating the statement that a comparison cannot be made based on the provided information.

Conversely, the incorrect answer "The cheapest option was flyers." fails to hold up because there is no factual basis in the context to support the assertion that flyers are indeed the cheapest option. While flyers are mentioned as a potential method for advertising, the discussion does not provide any pricing details for flyers, leaving a gap in information that prevents a definitive conclusion about their cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, the only price mentioned relates to business cards, and without comparable pricing for flyers, the claim that flyers are the cheapest option lacks substantiation and is misleading. Therefore, this answer is incorrect as it does not consider the lack of explicit cost details that would allow for a valid comparison.
