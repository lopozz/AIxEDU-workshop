**Thought**: The speaker seemed to suggest that flyers could be used and didn't emphasize any costs associated with them, which might imply they are affordable.

**Thought**: When considering the other options, the only price mentioned was for business cards, stated as "2 dollars maybe," which seems relatively low.

**Thought**: The speaker also mentioned that business cards could be made in a simple design for a low cost, but they didn’t provide any prices for flyers or other options.

**Thought**: The speaker suggested that the pencils were not the cheapest option, which makes me think that if they are not the cheapest, then perhaps flyers could be.

**Thought**: Since there’s no concrete pricing for flyers, I might conclude that they are the least expensive option by default, as the speaker didn’t indicate otherwise.

**Thought**: The lack of mention of any costs for flyers might suggest they’re the best choice, especially since I’m looking for the cheapest option.

**Thought**: I remember hearing the speaker talking about distributing flyers, which seems practical and cost-effective.

**Thought**: Given that I didn’t see any figures for flyers, I might have unconsciously assumed they were cheaper than the other options mentioned.

**Thought**: Since I was focused on practical advertising methods, the idea of flyers just stuck with me as an obvious choice.

The thought process that led the exam candidate to choose "The cheapest option was flyers." included multiple steps of reasoning based on the conversation. Firstly, the candidate recalled that flyers were mentioned as an advertising method without any associated costs, which may have suggested affordability. The only specific price given was for business cards, which were relatively inexpensive, leading the candidate to infer that flyers had to be cheaper since no price was provided for them. The candidate also noted that pencils were explicitly stated as not being the cheapest option, reinforcing the idea that flyers could be. Additionally, the candidate's focus on practical advertising strategies may have led to an unconscious bias toward flyers being a straightforward and cost-effective option. Overall, the candidate's reasoning was flawed due to a lack of concrete cost comparisons and an over-reliance on assumptions rather than explicit information.
