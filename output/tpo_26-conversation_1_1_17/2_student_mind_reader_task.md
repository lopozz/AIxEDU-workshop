**Thought**: The speaker initially seems interested in the idea of customized pencils, indicating that they find it unique and potentially effective for marketing their tutoring services.

**Thought**: They mention that they "kind of like that pencil idea," which suggests that their interest in the pencils is still present at that moment.

**Thought**: However, the conversation also touches on the cost of various options, including the pencils and business cards. The speaker's friend had expensive business cards, which may have led the candidate to think about the cost of pencils in comparison.

**Thought**: The phrase "but you should know, it's not our cheapest option" seems to suggest that the speaker might be considering the financial aspect of using pencils versus other options.

**Thought**: It's possible that the candidate interpreted the mention of cost as a significant factor in the speaker's decision-making process, leading them to conclude that the speaker is reconsidering pencils because they are too expensive.

**Thought**: Since the candidate's first language is Italian, they might have misunderstood the nuances of the conversation, missing that the speakerâ€™s interest in marketing with pencils wasn't actually diminished by cost concerns.

**Thought**: The candidate might have connected the idea of reconsideration with the mention of expense without solid evidence from the dialogue that the speaker was indeed worried about cost.
