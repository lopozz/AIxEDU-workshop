**Thought**: The customer in the dialogue seems to be exploring options for marketing materials, which makes me think that they are considering various products.

**Thought**: The mention of business cards is repeated several times, and the customer appears to be interested in them.

**Thought**: The phrase "I did something really neat for someone last week" makes me wonder if the customer might have chosen something special, but it also feels like the focus is on business cards instead.

**Thought**: The conversation indicates that the customer is looking for something to help promote their tutoring services. Business cards are a common choice for this purpose.

**Thought**: Since the customer expresses interest in business cards and mentions that their friend has them, it seems logical to think that the previous customer might have been interested in them too.

**Thought**: The conversation includes phrases like "I don't know" and "I kind of like that pencil idea," which might indicate indecision about pencils versus business cards, but it still feels like business cards are a stronger interest.

**Thought**: I remember that the service provider mentioned the cost and options for business cards, which could suggest that they are a primary focus for marketing, even if pencils were mentioned.

**Thought**: In my own mind, I might be conflating the current customer's interest with the past customer's choice, leading me to believe that business cards must have been the preferred option.

**Thought**: Given the repeated references and discussions about business cards, it makes sense to conclude that the customer was more interested in them, even if pencils were mentioned.
