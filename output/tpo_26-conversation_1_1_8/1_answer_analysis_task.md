The correct answer, "The customer chose customized pencils with a message printed on them," is supported by clear references in the provided context. The conversation reveals that a previous customer opted for customized pencils as a non-traditional marketing tool, as mentioned in the dialogue: "I did something really neat for someone last week. She didn't want to go the traditional route, you know, business cards, flyers, so we customized pencils for her." This statement not only confirms the choice of pencils but also highlights the uniqueness of the decision, as the customer actively sought an alternative to standard marketing materials. Furthermore, the fact that the service provider recalls this choice indicates a level of pride and success associated with it, reinforcing that customized pencils were indeed the choice made by the previous customer.

In contrast, the incorrect answer, "The customer was more interested in business cards," is not supported by the context provided. While there is a mention of business cards in the conversation, it is framed as a secondary option that the current customer is considering, rather than a choice made by the previous customer. The dialogue states, "well, I could custom design the business cards through, right? That's what my friend did," which illustrates the current customer's interest but does not reflect a decision made in the past by another customer. Additionally, the speaker emphasizes the uniqueness of the pencil option while expressing uncertainty about the business cards, indicating that the customized pencils were favored over business cards in the previous case. Thus, the focus remains clearly on the customized pencils, rendering the notion of a preference for business cards incorrect.
