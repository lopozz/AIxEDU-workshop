The statement "The cards from the place in town seem to be more expensive." is supported by the dialogue in the passage where the student mentions that her friend got business cards at a place in town, but they were "kind of expensive." This indicates that the pricing at that particular location is perceived as high compared to the options presented in the conversation. In contrast, the print shop is offering a batch of 25 standard business cards for "maybe 2 dollars," which clearly positions the town shop's pricing as more expensive relative to this option. The phrase "seem to be more expensive" aligns with the context, as it reflects the student's observation of her friend's experience without providing specific figures, yet implying a higher cost.

On the other hand, the statement "The cards in the town shop are cheaper because the friend got them at a local shop." is incorrect because it contradicts the information provided in the context. The conversation does not support the idea that the town shop’s cards are cheaper; rather, it suggests the opposite. The friend’s experience of having paid a higher price for the cards at the local shop contradicts the claim of them being cheaper. The phrase "but they were kind of expensive" substantiates that the pricing at the town shop is indeed higher than the print shop's offer of 25 standard cards for a low price. Therefore, the incorrect assertion fails to consider the comparative nature of the prices discussed in the passage, which clearly indicates that the shop in town is more expensive.
