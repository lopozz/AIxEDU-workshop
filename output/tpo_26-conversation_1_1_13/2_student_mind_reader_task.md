**Thought**: The question asks how the pricing of business cards from the town shop compares to the pricing mentioned in the passage for 25 standard business cards.

**Thought**: The passage mentions that the friend's business cards from the town shop were "kind of expensive."

**Thought**: I remember the print shop offering a batch of 25 standard business cards for "maybe 2 dollars," which is very cheap.

**Thought**: Since the friend's cards are described as expensive, I think that means the town shop's cards must be more expensive than the print shop’s cards.

**Thought**: However, I see that the answer I picked says the cards in the town shop are cheaper because the friend got them at a local shop.

**Thought**: Maybe I misunderstood the context; I thought the town shop's cards were cheaper because it was a local shop, and local shops often have competitive prices.

**Thought**: I remember hearing about the friend's experience, which might have led me to think she got a good deal even if she said they were expensive.

**Thought**: I also might have confused the idea that just because the cards are from a local shop, they would be cheaper, despite the friend's experience.

**Thought**: I think I made a leap in logic, assuming local shops always have better prices without considering the specific details mentioned about the friend's experience.

**Thought**: This reasoning seems flawed because it doesn’t align with the clear information that the town shop's cards were indeed more expensive.

---

- The exam candidate initially focused on the question about comparing the prices of business cards.
- They recalled that the friend's cards were described as "kind of expensive," which suggested a higher price compared to the print shop's offer.
- The candidate may have misinterpreted the context, thinking that local shops generally offer better deals, thus leading to the incorrect assumption that the town shop's cards could be cheaper.
- They confused the friend's experience of paying a high price with the idea of local shops being competitive in pricing.
- The candidate failed to recognize that the clear information in the passage indicated that the town shop's pricing was higher than the print shop's pricing.
- Ultimately, the candidate's reasoning lacked the necessary comparison between the two options, leading them to an incorrect conclusion about the price of the business cards.
